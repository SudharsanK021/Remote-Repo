------------------>Introduction to VSAM<---------------->lesson 1

VSAM = VIRTUAL STORAGE ACCESS METHOD ( IT IS FILE STORAGE SYSTEM)
---> FOR DATA ORGANIZATION 
----> STORING AND RETRIEVING DATA 
----> ORGANIZING CATALOGED STRUCTURE 
----> NOT A PROG LANG OR A DATABASE 
----> NOT EQUIVALENT OT PDS


TIME LINE :
1973: First VSAM introduced - Standard VSAM
1975: Enhanced VSAM introduced
1979: DF/EF(Data Facility Extended function) VSAM introduced


TYPES:
KSDS = KEY SEQUENCE   ( DATA AREA + INDEX AREA )  ( IN ORDER OF KEY FIELD)
ESDS = ENTRY SEQUENCE ( DATA AREA ALONE )( IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER)
RRDS = RELATIVE RECORD ( DATA AREA ALONE )( IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER)
LDS   = LINEAR  ( DATA AREA ALONE )( IT IS OF LONG STREAM BYTES) 



ESDS : ( FIXED BLOCK AND VARIABLE BLOCK  ) 
--------> DATA CAN BE APPENDED AT LAST 
--------> INSERT DELETE AND MODIFY 
------->  IT HAS ONLY DATA COMPONENT

KSDS  :  
-------->  CAN BE FIXED AND VARIBALE BLOCK 
--------> ALLOWS AIX 
--------> CAN SPAN AND UNSPAN RECORD 
-------->  INSERT DELETE MODIFY 
--------> CAN INSERT RECORD ANYWHERE 
--------> IT IS DYNAMIC= SEQUENTIAL + RANDOM & SEQUENTIAL & RANDOM 
--------> KEY REORD FIELD SHOULD BE UNIQUE 


RRDS (SUPPORTS FIXED LENGTH / FIXED BLOCK ONLY ) : 
--------> PREFORMATED SLOTS OF FB 
--------> CAN ACCESS SEQ AND RANDOM 
-------->  EACH SLOT IS IDENTIFIED BY relative position , WHICH  is called the Relative Record Number (RRN) of the slot.


LDS :  
-------> CAN BE ACCESSED AS BYTE ADDRESSABLE STRING 
------->  USED FOR BACKEND AND APPLICATION Data 
--------> Logical records must be “blocked” and “deblocked” by the application program. 
--------> Control infos of records is not available in control area 

CLUSTERS : SET OF CATALOG ENTRIES 

KSDS CLUSTER : INDEX AND DATA COMPONENT
ESDS CLUSTER : DATA COMPONENT 
RSDS CLUSTER : DATA COMPONENT 

ADVANTAGES :
	Protection of Data
	Cross-system (MVS & VSE) Compatibility
	Device Independence (Access Via Catalog)
	Provision to include IDCAMS commands in JCL to handle VSAM
	Provision for VSCOBOL II/PL-I/ASSEMBBLY Language to access VSAM dataset



DISADVANTAGES :
	VSAM requires more storage space than other types of datasets, this is because
	VSAM datasets carry control information in them, in addition to the actual data that    they are comprised of.
	VSAM datasets require additional storage free space that must be embedded inthem. This free space results in more efficient management of the data contained in    them, when records are added, deleted or changed.
	Integrity of VSAM datasets in cross-region and cross-system sharing must be    controlled by the user.
