--------------------------------REPRO AND BACKING VSAM


REPRO :  **************************************IT IS NEW VERSION OF IEBGENER IN VSAM 
	USED TO TRANSFER DATA BETWEEN NON VSAM AND VSAM 
	AND BETWEEN TYPES OF VSAM DS


USES  : 
	LOADS EMPTY DS WITH DATA
	BACK UPS VSAM
	MERGES TWO DATASETS


ADVANTAGE : 

	ISAM CAN BE CONVERTED INTO VSAM 
	PS TO VSAM - RECORD TRANSFER
	IN KSDS , ESDS , RRDS THIER COMPOMENETS ARE BUILT AUTOPMATICALLY

DISADVANTAGE : 
	CATLG INFO NOT TRANSFERED
	REDEFINION OF CLUSER TO BE MADE WHILE USED OR REUSE CAN BE CODED( when esds to ksds or rrds to ksds ) 


SYNTAX  :

		REPRO
		INFILE (ddname) 		| 	INDATASET (dsname) -
		OUTFILE (ddname)		| 	OUTDATASET (dsname) -




PARAMTERES OF REPRO  :

------------> FROMKEY – TOKEY
		 USE OF PRIMARY KEY
		 IN KSDS IS USED 

 ------------> FROMADDRESS- TOADDRESS  /   FROM RBA TO RBA
		 USE OF RECORD SIZE 
		IF RECORDSIZE IS 80  AND CISZ IS 512 , THEN THE RECORDS CAN BE
			1ST IN ( 0 79 )  , 
			2ND RECORD IN (80 160) ,
			 3RD IN (160 240) ,
			 4TH IN (320 400), 5TH IN (480 ) , 
			WHWERE AS IN 481 TO 512 IS UNUSED SPACE AND CONTROL FIELD 

 ------------> FROMNUMBER-TONUMBER  
		 USE OF RELATIVE RECORD NUMBER   AND USED IN RRDS


 ------------>  SKIP,COUNT : TO SKIP SOME AND COPY THE NUMBER OF COUNT IN COUNT PRARAM 




**********************************************BACKING UP DATASET 

	INVLOVES THREE STEPS  :
			DELETE , DEFINE , REPRO 




BACKING UP EFFECTS : 

	The dataset is reorganized, that is the control interval and control area splits are eliminated.
	Free space is redistributed throughout the dataset, as specified in the FREESPACE Parameter.
	Primary index is rebuilt, however the DELETE command deletes the base cluster as well as its indexes.
	************************************ alternate indexes AIX have to be redefined. 


REUSE IN REPRO : 
		IF THE VSAM CLUSTER IS CREATED WID REUSE OPTION IT CAN ALSO BE USED IN REPRO 
		IF VSAM DIDNT USE REUSE , THEN REPRO IGNORES IT 




DELETE COMMANSDS USED IN :

	FORCE|NOFORCE: FORCE allows an item to be deleted even if it is non-empty.
	
	PURGE|NOPURGE: PURGE allows an item to be deleted even if its expiration date has not arrived.
	
	SCRATCH|NOSCRATCH: SCRATCH scratches the non-VSAM datasets. NOSCRATCH  just un-catalogs the dataset.
		UNLESS ERASE IS USED THE SCRATCH DELETES THE CATALOG INFOS ALONE 





********************************************************REORGANIZATION OF KSDS CLUSTER 

1.  Make a backup of the KSDS into a PS using REPRO command.
2. Delete the KSDS with the AMS DELETE command.
3. Define the KSDS using DEFINE CLUSTER command.
4. Reload the KSDS from the backup file using the REPRO command


REASON FOR REORG OF KSDS : 
	IT IS DONE WHEN FREQUENT USE OF DS IS HAPPENING AND IT MAKES CA AND CI TO SPLIT 
	WHEN CA SPLIT VALUE GOES TO 15 % OF CA VALUE REORGANIXATION HAS TO BE DONE ELSE , OUT OF SEQUENCE OR ERROR OCCURS 

*****************************************************************************************************



IMPORT AND EXPORT :

	EMPORT / IMPORT has several advantages compared to REPRO
		• Catalog information is exported along with data
		• Cluster deletion and redefinition not required during import as input dataset already contains catalog information
		• Easily ported on other systems as catalog information available with data
		• Like REPRO KSDS datasets are reorganized however three steps of REPRO are replaced by one
			
	Disadvantages:
		• Exported data cannot be processed until Imported
		• Can be used only for VSAM dataset


SYNTAX : 
EXPORT MFCVT01.KSDS.CLUSTER
OUTFILE(DD2)


IMPORT INFILE (DD2)-
OUTDATASET(MFCVT01.KSDS.CLUSTER)
Imports only EXPORTED dataset
